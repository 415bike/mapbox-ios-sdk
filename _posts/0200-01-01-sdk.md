The [MapBox iOS SDK](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk) is based on the [Route-Me](https://github.com/route-me/route-me) open source project ([Alpstein fork](https://github.com/Alpstein/route-me)) and is quite similar in behavior to Apple's [MapKit](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/MapKit/Reference/MapKit_Framework_Reference) framework, but with much greater flexibility for visual styling, offline use, and general customizability -- plus it's open source! 

## SDK Installation (Binary)

Follow these steps in order to use the MapBox iOS SDK within your own Xcode 4 project in the fastest way possible. 

 1. Obtain the TileJSON URL for your map by going to the **Info** tab, clicking **Embed**, and copying the **TileJSON URL**. This URL contains all the metadata needed by the SDK in order to serve your map. 
 1. Download the latest SDK binary release from the [downloads](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/downloads) and drag `MapBox.framework` into your project's `Frameworks` section, adding it to your target. 
 1. Add `-ObjC` to your app target's `Other Linker Flags` build setting in order to ensure that the SDK's static library has all symbols loaded, even for categories. 
 1. Add the following libraries to your app target's `Link Binary With Libraries` build phase: 
   * `CoreLocation.framework` (required for location services)
   * `QuartzCore.framework` (required because of advanced layer manipulation)
   * `libsqlite3.dylib` (required for MBTiles and caching support)
   * `libz.dylib` (required for UTFGrid interactivity)
 1. If you plan on using user location services, alias (or copy) the relevant assets in `MapBox.framework/Resources` into your project so that the images get copied into the product. 
 1. At a minimum, `#import <MapBox/MapBox.h>` and instantiate an `RMMapView` in your code using `-initWithReferenceURL:` and an `NSURL` made from your **TileJSON URL** obtained above. 

## SDK Installation (Source)

Follow these steps in order to use the MapBox iOS SDK within your own Xcode 4 project while retaining the ability to edit the SDK source as you go.  

 1. Obtain the TileJSON URL for your map by going to the **Info** tab, clicking **Embed**, and copying the **TileJSON URL**. This URL contains all the metadata needed by the SDK in order to serve your map. 
 1. Download the SDK source code from the [repository](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk) and put it someplace in your project's folder. We assume below that this is a top-level folder called `MapBox-iOS-SDK`. 
 1. Add `MapView.xcodeproj` to your project's file sources, either by dragging it into your project from Finder or via `File > Add Files...`, in order to make the library available to your project. 
 1. Add `-ObjC` to your app target's `Other Linker Flags` build setting in order to ensure that the SDK's static library has all symbols loaded, even for categories. 
 1. Add `"$(SRCROOT)/MapBox-iOS-SDK"` (per your folder naming scheme) to the `Header Search Paths` build setting for your app target in order to gain access to the headers. Be sure to check the `Recursive` option. 
 1. Add the `MapView` target to your app target's `Target Dependencies` build phase in order to build the library when you build your project. 
 1. Add the following libraries to your app target's `Link Binary With Libraries` build phase: 
   * `CoreLocation.framework` (required for location services)
   * `QuartzCore.framework` (required because of advanced layer manipulation)
   * `libMapView.a` (required to include the SDK)
   * `libsqlite3.dylib` (required for MBTiles and caching support)
   * `libz.dylib` (required for UTFGrid interactivity)
 1. If you plan on using user location services, alias (or copy) the relevant assets in `MapView/Map/Resources` into your project so that the images get copied into the product. 
 1. At a minimum, `#import "RMMapView.h"` and instantiate an `RMMapView` in your code using `-initWithReferenceURL:` and an `NSURL` made from your **TileJSON URL** obtained above. 

## API reference

Below we'll talk about the major components used when building a map-based iOS app with our SDK. We're assuming you have a general familiarity with Apple's developer tools, the Cocoa framework, and the Objective-C language and conventions. 

### Map view ([`RMMapView`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMMapView.h) class)

The map view is the basic view that you'll work with to display a map that pans and zooms in response to gestures. You can instantiate a map view in code or you can embed one in an Interface Builder (`.xib`) file, just like any other `UIView` subclass. By default, if not configured with a TileJSON URL (see **SDK Installation** above), the map view will display [OpenStreetMap](http://www.openstreetmap.org/). There are options to control the map style (with tile sources), markers and shapes on the map, offline caching policy, zooming limits, retina display behavior, starting coordinate, and map view dragging deceleration, among other parameters. 

### Map view delegate ([`RMMapViewDelegate`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMMapViewDelegate.h) protocol)

Following Objective-C's customary [delegation design pattern](https://developer.apple.com/library/ios/#documentation/General/Conceptual/DevPedia-CocoaCore/Delegation.html), a map view can have an optional delegate object in order to help make interaction decisions. Some of these decisions include: 

 * Setup and display of markers and other annotations on the map view (see **Markers & shapes** below)
 * Pre- and post-move and zoom response handlers in order to, for example, update another interface element in response to a map drag
 * Gesture handlers for taps, double-taps, and long-presses on the map
 * Interaction handlers for markers and other annotations

### Tile sources ([`RMTileSource`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMTileSource.h) protocol)

Tile sources are a concept similar to changing between standard, satellite, and hybrid styles in MapKit, but with much more customizability. With tile sources, the map style can be changed by providing one or more online or offline tile-based layers to display on the map from a variety of providers. In addition, the MapBox SDK supports client-side compositing of tile layers for increased performance and responsiveness. 

The tile sources that support MapBox's core technology include [`RMMapBoxSource`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMMapBoxSource.h) for online layers from [MapBox Hosting](http://mapbox.com/plans/) or a [TileStream](https://github.com/mapbox/tilestream) server, and the [`RMMBTilesSource`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMMBTilesSource.h) for use of offline-capable [MBTiles](http://mapbox.com/mbtiles-spec/) layers. 

### Markers & shapes ([`RMMapLayer`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMMapLayer.h) and subclasses)

Markers and other visual additions above the map tile layers are managed with `RMMapLayer` and its subclasses: 

 * [`RMMarker`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMMarker.h) - points and images
 * [`RMShape`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMShape.h) - vector lines and other custom shapes
 * [`RMCircle`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMCircle.h) - perfect vector circles

In addition, any `RMMapLayer`, as a `CALayer` subclass, can have its `contents` property set to a `CGImage` and the layer will be panned and zoomed with the map automatically. You may wish to use the map view's delegate callbacks to respond to map zooms, however, in order to redraw the image according to zoom level in order to preserve the best visual appearance. 

Markers and shapes are added in a manner similar to MapKit, where annotation data objects are added to the map view, then the map view delegate answers requests for the actual layers to be displayed when they are first needed, providing better performance. 

### Embedded interactivity ([`RMInteractiveSource`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMInteractiveSource.h) protocol)

Embedded interactivity (based on the [UTFGrid specification](http://mapbox.com/mbtiles-spec/utfgrid/)) is a way to embed arbitrary point and region data with a tile map layer for fast and convenient recall when needed. See [visible map](http://mapbox.com/demo/visiblemap/) for an example. The primary advantage to this technology is fast interactivity in web browsers, but the MapBox iOS SDK also features easy support for it for cross-platform use of the same maps. 

In order to make use of UTFGrid interactivity on iOS, just include the `RMInteractiveSource` file. Any `RMMapBoxSource` (online) or `RMMBTilesSource` (offline) tile sources will get methods added to them allowing querying of interactivity for a given map view and `CGPoint`, suitable for use when the map is tapped or other gestures are applied. For example, tapping a given map point within a country's borders might return the HTML-formatted content necessary to display the country's name and flag image in a popup. 

### Tile caching ([`RMTileCache`](https://github.com/mapbox/mapbox-ios-sdk/blob/develop/MapView/Map/RMTileCache.h) class)

We offer unrestricted caching of map tiles for offline use in mobile clients. Please take a look at [our documentation on caching and offline use](/mobile/docs/offline/) as well as our liberal [terms of service](/tos/) (see **Caching Policy**).
